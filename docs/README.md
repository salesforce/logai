To generate documentation using Sphinx, just run the script build_docs.sh. 
The build/html directory will be populated with searchable, indexed HTML documentation.

Note that our documentation also depends on Pandoc to render Jupyter notebooks. 
For Ubuntu, call `sudo apt-get install pandoc`. For Mac OS, install Homebrew and call `brew install pandoc`.
